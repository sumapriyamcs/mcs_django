1.PROGRAMS:
It is a sequence of instruction designed to do a task.

2.Instruction:
It is a command or an order for a computer to do specific task.

3.SOFTWARE
Software is a set of instruction or program that are responsible either for Operating a
system or performing a specific task.
Software is a collection of programs (interrelated & interdependent) written to
achieve a goal (application).

4.Classifications:

It is done based on place where we use the software.

• System software
• Application software

4.1.System software:

The software which are responsible for Operating a particular system, such type of
software we called it as System software.

System s/w is nothing but set of programs to control and manage the operations of a
computer hardware.

System Software required to run the hardware parts of the computer and other application
software.

It controls the allocation and usage of different hardware components.

Types: operating system software:
Windows 10, linux, unix, mac os

Utility s/w:
File compression, images, and antivirus programs.

Device drivers:
Keyword devices, mouse touch pen printers.
Ex: - Operating System (OS)

4.2:Application software:

The software which are responsible for performing specific task, such type of
software we called it as application software.
Ex: - Web application, client-server application

1) Stand-alone application

Name itself says that the application will be standing it own.
• There is no need of internet.
• It is independent of OS.
Ex: - calculator, Ms-office, paint

2) Web application
The application which are access through web browser, such type of application we
called it as web application. All the we application informations are present in web servers.
Ex: - Facebook, youtube, skype, pyspider

3) Client-server application
In this type we have to install client software and we will be requesting information
through the remote server present in the system and web.
Ex: - Atm,

5.Architecture:

It is a design pattern in which application is built. It is used to specify the flow of
execution of faces in the application. It is of three types.
• One-tier Architecture
• Two-tier Architecture
• N-tier Architecture
One-tier Architecture

In this type of application, we will be having only one end called as Frontend. By
using this frontend only, we‘ll be doing all the transactions. If we want to change or modify
some data then we have to go to respective html page and make the change. We call this
architecture as static architecture.

As it is static, it is not preferable in real time.
Two-tier Architecture
In this type of application, we will be having two ends,
• Frontend
• Backend

Frontend is used for view of the data to the user, Backend is used for receiving the
data from frontend and as well as sending the data to the frontend. We can call this type as
medium or semi dynamic architecture.

N-tier Architecture
In this type of application, we will be having three ends,
• Frontend
• Backend
• Database

Frontend is used to view of data to the user, Backend is used for receiving the data
from frontend and as well as sending the data to the frontend. Database layer is used to
storing the data and as well as sending the data to backend.

Interaction between Frontend and Backend happens through http (hypertext transfer
protocol).

6.WEB APPLICATION::

1. This is the application/softwa  re that runs with the help of the browser to do a
particular task.
2.A web app is a computer program that utilizes web browser and web
server/application servers to perform tasks over the internet. (or) A web app is a
program that is stored on a remote server and sent over the internet through a browser
interface.
3.The application will be designed in the below structure.

7.BROWSER:
1. A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide
Web.
2.Web browser is a client software using which we do the interaction with the servers.
3.When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves
the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the user's
device.

8.REQUEST:

1.This is the set of instruction and information which is send by the browser to the
server based on their requirements.

9.RESPONSE:
1. This is the set of instruction and information that we are getting to the server based on
the request.

9.SERVER:

1. It is a computer which is installed by the software that is the capability of providing
the services based on the users request.
(Or)
2.It is a computer with a high configuration and installed with software that makes the
computer to provide the service requested.
3.Server contains HTML code, CSS Code, JS code, fonts, images, python files, videos,
bootstrap, Data base
4.The software which will make a normal computer as a server are called Server
Software.

#Example1. APACHE
2.XAMPP
3. WAMPP
4.TOMCAT
5.ETC…..

There are set of Operating System that will make a computer as a server.
#Example:
1. Windows server operating system.
2.Linux server operating system
3.Ubuntu server operating system
4.Fedora server operating system
5.If ever we are using normal operating system (or) client OS there, we need to installed
the server software to give the extra capability of computer to the server but if we
installed the OS itself server OS than that particular point of time our computer get
the capability of serving the users request.

10.DATABASE SERVER:

1.It is a server containing the database where all required set of data is stored. The db
server can be inside an application server (or) it will be outside the application server.

2.When the application is very large and contains lot of data in that case we are going to
use the database server as a separate and dedicate the server.

3.If keep the database server outside the application server than in that case in another
computer which we need to be as a db server we are going to install is server s/w that
will make our computer to get the capability of serving the server application request
(or) the application server db request.

Example: db server software are
1. Mysql
2. Oracle server
3. Postgre SQL server
4. Etc….

A server consists of lost of many set of information such as the codes of html, CSS,
JavaScript, Bootstrap and Python and data such as images, fonts, videos, PDF etc.. And query
language to interact to database (structure query language or non structured query language).
To organize/control/maintain all the set of instruction /information to the server we are going
to use the tool called Framework.

4.That can be framework in development (or) in test automation.

11.FRAMEWORK:

Framework is software which is designed to support development of an application.
1.It is a set of rules and regulations that helps to organize or structure the files inside a
server.
2.If we take development framework examples several language will have own
language.
1. Spring and hibernate in JAVA
2. Lara well in PHP
3. .Net in C#
4. Django, Flask, Pyramid in PYTHON.
Etc…..
3. We can development an application even without using framework but it taken a lot
of time to get process and get ready or to go for the execution. We don‘t prefer to
create application without using framework.

12.Web-Framework:

Framework which is used for developing web-applications is known as Web-Framework.
There are two types of Web-Framework.
• Micro framework
• Major framework
Micro framework
By using micro frameworks, we can design wed application which are suitable for
small-scale industries. By using these only few users can work at a time.
Major framework
By using major frameworks, we can design large-scale application.

Application developed using Python
• Netflix
• Instagram
• Spotify
• Dropbox
• Uber
• Reddit

Pinterest
• Disqus
